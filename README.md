# Bright-task
Infrastructure deployment automation script(s) using Terraform on the AWS platform. This configuration includes:

1. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a target group and listener. (loadbalancer.tf)
2. An EC2 instance running the Apache HTTP server on Ubuntu 22.04 (web-server-vm.tf)

### This part is not finished
3. An RDS instance with a MySQL database. (db.tf) 
I was not sure on how show easily database connection from web-server

Next step would be to figure it out, propably implementing mysql client in the webserver (updating vm-configuration.tpl - commented code)

4. An Amazon SQS queue for messaging. (sqs.tf)
5. An IAM role and policy for the EC2 instance to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch and send messages to the SQS queue.
